<p>1. INSANE HANDLE</p>
Kyrie has one of the best handles in the NBA and he 
says all of his amazing moves ocome from 
simple handles with pacing, combination of moves, 
and attention to counter moves from the defense

<br>
<p>2. PERFECT JUMPSHOT</p>
Pretty self explanitory, in basketball if you can shoot well, you can score poins. If you 
can score points, the points add up. The more you score the more chance you have to win. Players like Kyrie practice by 
perfecting their shooting form and making sure their aim is perfectly alligned

<br>
<p>3. GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP</p>
Kyrie is both an amazing player and a good sport. 
He treats his fellow players, teammates, coaches, and referees with respect and care.
